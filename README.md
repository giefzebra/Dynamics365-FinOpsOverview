# Introduction
This repository is going to be used for any documentation on things which I find interesting in Dynamics 365. There will be a combination of functionality and technical content which I will publish here, primarily for my own reference, but also for something I can point at for something I want to do.

Historically, I've tried to use video content, so I may look at embedding this where possible, but we shall see. I've only used GitHub previously for stashing C# learnings and bits I wanted to share with colleagues, so it'll be a fun journey!
